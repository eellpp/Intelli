### What is text analytics
- is the process of deriving high-quality information from text
- is the process of extracting the meaning from unstructured text
- is the process of converting unstructured text data into meaningful data for further analysis


Given an unstructured textual data set, text analytics is a series of transformation to get insights from data. 

- news articles from website
- comments on social media
- email content
- financial reports
- chat transcriptions
- transactional data like invoices, claims

#### How is it different from NLP

Text analytics is a broader domain whereas NLP is focused on extracting information from text written in natural languages. Text analytics may be performed on datasets not composed in natural languages like financial reports, invoices, claims etc.
